## Repository Availability 
Repository availability is an uptime metric for Certificate Revocation List availability, based on monitoring by the FPKIMA. The table only contains Certification Authorities directly signed by the Federal Common Policy Root CA, Federal Bridge CA 2016 or Federal Bridge CA G4. A metric of "99" in the table below means the Certificate Revocation List was available for 99% of the given month, in other words, the file was not available for 1% of the month. The last column is the 12-month average.
