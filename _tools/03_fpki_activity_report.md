## Repository Availability 
Respository availability is an uptime metric for Certificate Revocation List availability. The table only contains Certification Authorities directly certified with the FPKIMA. A metric of "99" in the table below means the Certificate Revocation List was available for 99% of the given month, in other words, the file was not available for 1% of the month (18 minutes depending on the month). The last column is the 12-Month average.
