## Worksheet 13:&nbsp;&nbsp;PIV-I Card Authentication Certificate Profile

| **Field** |       |       | **Value**                             |
| :-------- | :---: | :---: | :-------------------------------     |
| Version   |       |       | V3 (2)                                 |
| Serial Number   |       |       | Must be unique. |
| Issuer Signature Algorithm   |       |       |  One of the following: <br>sha256 WithRSAEncryption {1 2 840 113549 1 1 11} <br>ecdsa-with-SHA256 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.2} <br>ecdsa-with-SHA384 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.3} <br>ecdsa-with-SHA512 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.4}. | 
| Issuer Distinguished Name   |       |       |  Unique X.500 Issuing CA DN.  |
| Validity Period   |       |       |  No longer than 3 years from date of issue.<BR>Expressed in UTCTime for dates until end of 2049 and GeneralizedTime for dates thereafter.  | 
| Subject   |       |       |   MUST inclue a Non-NULL Subject DN. See naming requirements in [1].   |
| Subject Public Key Information   |       |       |   For RSA, must be at least 2048 bit modulus, rsaEncryption {1 2 840 113549 1 1 1}.<BR>For ECC, implicitly specify parameters through an OID associated with a NIST-approved curve referenced in NIST SP 800-78-2.   |
| Signature   |       |       |   sha256 WithRSAEncryption {1 2 840 113549 1 1 11}<BR>or ECDSA with appropriate Hash.   |
|               |                 |              |                                       |
| **Extension** |  **Required**   | **Critical** | **Value**                             |
| KeyUsage  | Mandatory | True |  digitalSignature.  |
|AuthorityInfoAccess   | Mandatory  |  | **id-ad-caIssuers** {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2} access method entry contains HTTP URL for .p7c file containing certificates issued to Issuing CA.<BR>**id-ad-ocsp** {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1} access method entry contains HTTP URL for the Issuing CA OCSP Responder. OCSP is required for PIV-I CardAuth.  | 

**CELESTE STOPPED HERE**

| SubjectKeyIdentifier   | Mandatory |  | Octet string.  |
| CRLDistributionPoints   | Mandatory |   |  This extension must appear in all certificates and must include at least an HTTP URI distribution point name.<BR>The reasons and cRLIssuer fields must be omitted. | 
| CertificatePolicies   | Mandatory  |  | Applicable certificate policy:<BR>2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.17 - id-fpki-common-cardAuth<BR>Other policies may be asserted as well. |
| AuthorityKeyIdentifier   | Mandatory  |  | Octet string (same as subject key identifier in Issuing CA certificate). |
| Extendedkeyusage   | Mandatory | True |  This extension shall assert only the id-PIV-cardAuth keyPurposeID {2.16.840.1.101.3.6.8}.<BR>The id-PIV-cardAuth keyPurposeID specifies that the public key is used to authenticate the PIV card rather than the PIV cardholder.  |
|SubjectAlternativeName   | Mandatory  | Otherwise set criticality to TRUE. | Must include a UUID. No other name forms may be included.<BR>This field contains the UUID from the CHUID of the PIV-I card encoded as a URI, as specified in RFC 4122, Section 3.  |
|piv-interim<BR>(2.16.840.1.101.3.6.9.1)   | Mandatory  |  | The PIV interim indicator extension is defined in FIPS 201-2, Appendix B.2.<BR>The value of this extension is asserted as follows:<BR>1. TRUE if, at the time of credential issuance: (1) the FBI National Criminal History Fingerprint Check has been completed successfully, and (2) an NACI has been initiated but has not been completed.<BR>2. FALSE if, at the time of credential issuance, the subject’s NACI has been completed and successfully adjudicated.  |
| SubjectDirectoryAttributes   | Optional  |  | This extension may be included to indicate the cardholder's country or countries of citizenship, as specified in RFC 5280 [3].<BR>countryOfCitizenship {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.9.4} - ISO 3166 Country Code(s). | 
| IssuerAltName   | Optional  |  |   |
