To simplify certificate path building within your enterprise, you can *optionally* distribute the CA certificates [issued by the Federal Common Policy CA (FCPCA) G2](#certificates-issued-by-the-federal-common-policy-ca-g2). Sample procedures for the distribution of intermediate CA certificates are below:

1. Enter a GPO **Name** and click **OK**.
1. Right-click the newly created GPO and click **Edit**.
1. Navigate to **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Public Key Policies**.  
1. Right-click **Intermediate Certification Authorities**, and select **Import**.

1. Browse to and select the certificates [issued by the FCPCA G2](#certificates-issued-by-the-federal-common-policy-ca-g2) that you want to distribute.

### Use macOS/iOS Configuration Profile

{% include alert-warning.html content="Only System or Mobile Device Management (MDM) Administrators should create, distribute, and install Apple Configuration Profiles." %} 

#### Create an Apple Configuration Profile

1. As an administrator, [download and verify] the certificates [issued by the FCPCA G2](#certificates-issued-by-the-federal-common-policy-ca-g2) that you want to distribute.   
2. Download and install *Configurator 2* from the Apple App Store.
3. Open *Configurator 2* and click **File** > **New Profile**.
4. On the **General** tab, enter a unique profile **Name** (for example, *FPKI Intermediate CA Certificate Distribution Profile*) and **Identifier** (for example, *FCPCAG2-Intermediate-0001*).
5. On the **Certificates** tab, click **Configure**.
6. Browse to and select the certificates you want to distribute.
7. (*Optional*) Add additional agency-specific configurations or customizations. 
8. Click **File** > **Save** to save your profile to your preferred location.
