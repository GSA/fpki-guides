Use the checklist below to prepare your agency for the migration to the Federal Common Policy CA (FCPCA) G2.  The checklist highlights activities as they relate to the following roles:
- **ENG** - Information technology engineers and system administrators
- **APP** - Application developers and owners
- **PM** - Project managers
- **CIO** - Chief information officers
- **CSO** - Chief security officers

We encourage agency staff to participate in steps where their roles appear in blue, bold font.
