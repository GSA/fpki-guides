### What is a trust store?
There are millions of identity certificates issued to people and devices around the world.  Certificates constantly change as some are revoked and others are issued&mdash;far too many for your computer to maintain an up-to-date list.  

Instead, a trust store (a list of **trusted root certificates**) is maintained.  When you are presented with a person or device certificate from a PIV credential, website, email, or some other digital item, your operating system or application will check to see whether the certificate has a valid path to one of the trusted root certificates in its trust store.

### What are the most commonly used trust stores?
Operating systems, browsers, and some commercial software use trust stores to verify whether a certificate with which you are being presented should be trusted.  

Here are some common trust stores. If the Federal Common Policy CA (FCPCA) (i.e., COMMON) root certificate is included in a trust store and distributed by _default_, the _Includes FCPCA (COMMON)?_ column below will say _Yes_.  

Trust Store|Includes FCPCA<br>(COMMON)?|Includes FCPCA G2|Trust Store Manager|Platforms Serviced|Program Information Location

### How do I set dynamic path validation for the Microsoft trust store in Windows operating systems?

With dynamic path validation (as opposed to static path validation), the certificate validation libraries will build the certificate chain based on the Authority Information Access (AIA) entry in the certificate.  

Dynamic path validation is a registry setting:

  1. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\ CertDllCreateCertificateChainEngine\Config
  1. Create a new DWORD entry.
  2. Add **_MaxAIAUrlRetrievalCertCount_** as the **name**.
  3. Set the value to **30**.
  4. Reboot your system (required). 

All registry settings for managed Federal Government computers should use group policy objects or the automated configuration management tools available in your agency. 

### What Federal PKI certificate policies are trusted by Adobe and how do I them?

A common question is *which certificate policy object identifiers (OIDs) are trusted?* The Federal PKI certificate policy OIDs trusted by Adobe are:

| Certificate Policies | OIDs | Certificate Use |
|:---------------------|:-----|:----------------|
| Common Hardware                               | 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.7  | PIV and Federal Bridge Medium Hardware Token                                      |
| Federal Bridge Medium Hardware Commercial Best Practice | 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.15 | Federal Bridge Medium Hardware Token (PKI Trusted Roles may not be U.S. citizens) |
| Common High                                   | 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.16 | High Assurance Policy                                                             |
| PIV-I Hardware                                | 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.18 | PIV-Interoperable                                                                 |
| SHA-1 Hardware (**For Legacy Purposes**)    	| 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.24	| SHA-1 Medium Hardware Tokens through SHA-1 Federal Root CA        |

Federal PKI certificates may be used for digitally signing documents between federal agencies and with business partners.  Adobe is just one option used for digital signatures.

To see and verify which Federal PKI certificate policy OIDs are trusted by Adobe Acrobat:

  1. Open Adobe Acrobat.  
  1. _Edit_ > _Preferences_ > _Signatures_ > _Identities & Trusted Certificates_ > _More_.
  2. Choose _Trusted Certificates_ from the left-hand sidebar.  
  3. Choose _Federal Common Policy CA_ and then the _Certificate Details_ tab.
  3. Choose the _Certificate Viewer_ window, and click the _Policies_ tab to see _Policy Restrictions_. 
  4. In _Certificate Policies_, you will see a comma-separated list of policy OIDs.
