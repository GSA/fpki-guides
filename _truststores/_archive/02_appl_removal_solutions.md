In September 2018, the U.S. Government removed the Federal Common Policy Certification Authority (CA) root certificate from the Apple certificate stores. This change affected all federal agency devices using Apple macOS Mojave, iOS 12, or tvOS 12 and may have an impact on the following services:  

- Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential authentication to government networks
- Agency web applications implementing client authentication (e.g., PIV authentication)
- Validation of digital signatures
- Other applications that leverage the Apple certificate stores

The root certificate is available immediately and will remain unchanged. Please use one of the [Solutions](#solutions) to mitigate negative impacts.
