## Engineering Guides

Federal Public Key Infrastructure engineering guides are to help engineers understand Federal Public Key Infrastructure certificates, manage configurations for tools and platforms, and provide code samples. 

We are migrating topics and content developed by the US Government and engineers, from sources that currently exists in word, pdf and other formats.  

Examples of topics we're working on:

* How to identify cross-certificates in the Federal PKI?
* What do sample certificates look like?
* How to use the Authority Information Access (AIA) and Subject Information Access (SIA) information in a FPKI certificate?
* How to digitally sign a document using Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF and have it be trusted?
* How to digitally sign and encrypt an email and verify the signature?
* How to digitally sign a document in the format expected by the Federal Register?
* How to identify all the certificate chains in the Federal PKI?


We invite you to contribute your knowledge!  You can [contribute]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/) to this effort or open an [Issue]({{site.github.repository_url}}/issues) to discuss a need you may have for a guide.
