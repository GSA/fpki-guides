### What is a Trust Store?
There are millions of identity certificates issued to people and devices in the world.  The certificates constantly change as some certificates are revoked and others are issued - far too many for your computer to maintain an up-to-date list.  

Instead, a list of **trusted root certificates** is maintained.  When you are presented with an person or device certificate from a PIV credential, website, email, or some other digital item, your system or application will check to see if the presented certificate has a valid certificate path to one of the trusted root certificates in the trust store. 

This list of trusted root certificates are contained within what is known as a **Trust Store** in either an application or operating system. 

### What are the most commonly used Trust Stores?
Operating systems, browsers, and some commercial software use trust stores to verify whether the certificate you are being presented should be trusted.  

Here is a table of common trust stores, and whether the Federal Common Policy CA (FCPCA) root certificate is included. 

Trust Store|Includes FCPCA?|Trust Store Manager|Platforms serviced|Program Information Location

### How do I set dynamic path validation for the trust store in Windows operating systems?

With dynamic path validation (as opposed to static path validation), the certificate validation software will build the certificate chain based on the Authority Information Access (AIA) entry in the certificate.  

Dynamic path validation is a registry setting:

  1. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\ CertDllCreateCertificateChainEngine\Config
  1. Create a new DWORD entry
  2. Add **_MaxAIAUrlRetrievalCertCount_** as the **name**
  3. Set the value to **30**
  4. A system reboot is required 

All registry settings for managed Federal Government computers should use group policy objects or the automated configuration management tools available in your agency. 

### How do I check which Federal PKI certificate policies are trusted by Adobe?
Federal PKI certificates may be used for digitally signing documents between federal agencies, and with business partners.  Adobe is just one option used for  digital signatures and a common question is which certificate policies are trusted. 

You can view which certificate policies are trusted in Acrobat by following these steps:

  1. Open Adobe Acrobat.  
  1. Edit > Preferences > Signatures > Identities & Trusted Certificates
  2. Choose _Trusted Certificates_ from the left-hand sidebar  
  3. Choose _Federal Common Policy CA_ , then the _Certificate Details_ tab
  3. Choose _Certificate Viewer_ window, click on the _Policies_ tab, and you will see _Policy Restrictions_ 
  4. In _Certificate Policies_ , you will see a comma-separated list of policy Object Identifiers (OIDs).


This is the current list for Federal Common Policy CA:
