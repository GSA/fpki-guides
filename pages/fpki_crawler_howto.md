title: How To Use the FPKI Crawler

As a federal agency or an entity supporting a federal agency, it is helpful to understand the relationships between the various certification authorities (CA) and how they relate to the federal agency security infrastucture.

The FPKI Crawler provides a view of these relationships of the CAs that are cross certified with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA).

## FPKI Graph

The FPKI Crawler provides a [FPKI Graph](https://fpki-graph.fpki-lab.gov/){:target="_blank"}_ to help you see the relationships between the CAs and Bridges in the FPKI ecosystem and the cross-certified CAs. You can also see how each CA certificate validates to the Root, COMMON.

* Click on any dot in the FPKI Graph to see that CA's inbound and outbound relationships. 

Each CA validating to COMMON should have an AIA extension in its public certificate that defines a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) where certificates issued to signing CA can be found. Following each CA certificateâ€™s AIA chain should result in finding the certificate that is certified by COMMON. Each CA should also have a Subject Information Access (SIA) extension in its public certificate that defines a URL where all CA certificates that it has issued can be found.

## FPKI Crawler Output Files

The [FPKI Crawler](https://fpki-graph.fpki-lab.gov/crawler/){:target="_blank"}_ (_AIA Crawler Results_ webpage) offers output files in CSV, HTML, XML, and .p7b formats to help you understand and administer your certificate Key Store and build a Trust Store. 

{% include alert-info.html heading="The FPKI Crawler uses AIAs and SIAs to find all CA certificates." content="Each CA public certificate should contain Authority Information Access (AIA) and Subject Information Access (SIA) extensions. An AIA chain will lead to the COMMON-certified CA certificate for download. The SIA gives a URL to a list of all certificates issued by a CA." %} 

### Public Certificates for Analysis and Reporting

**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crawler categorizes CA certificates by _Type_ (_U.S. Government_, _State_, or _Company_) and _Organization_ (_Agency_, _State Name_, and _Company Name_), which is extracted from the Distinguished Name (DN).

#### 1. Federal Common Policy Tree (_FederalCommonPolicyTree.csv_)

The _FederalCommonPolicyTree.csv_ (Microsoft Excel) gives you the certificate data for:

* All CAs that validate to COMMON
* All cross-certified CAs 

This data is useful to understand the relationships that exist between each CA and COMMON similar to the data presented in the graph in a visual format.

#### 2. All Certificates (_AIACrawler.html_)

The _AIACrawler.html_ (HTML) file lists all CA certificates found by the FPKI Crawler (in four Sections):

* **Certificates Found with Validated AIA Chains to COMMON &mdash;** All CA certificates with validated paths to COMMON and the certificate policies to which they validate. 
* **Certificates Found with Validated Chains to COMMON, NOT Found through AIA &mdash;** All CA certificates with validated paths to COMMON and the certificate policies to which they validate. (These certificates are found via JDK PKIX, when no validating chain is found via AIA.)   
* **Certificates Found with NO Validated Chains to COMMON &mdash;** All CA certificates with NO validated path to COMMON. (These certificates are found through using AIA and SIA extensions.) This file lists only certificate information. (These tend to be cross-certificates issued to FPKI CAs that allow a partner PKI to use its own Root CA as the trust anchor instead of COMMON.)
* **All Certificates &mdash;** All CA certificates in the FPKI.

For each CA certificate listed, you will see _Cert_ and _Issuer_ data and status. For example:

   ```
  Issuer CN=Federal Bridge CA 2016,OU=FPKI,O=U.S. Government,C=US serial# 0x03F42   status GOOD
   ```
   
For detailed data about CA certificates or issuers, click any link in the _AIACrawler.html_ file.

#### 3. Certificates with AIA Information (_allcertsfoundaturi.xml_)

The _allcertsfoundaturi.xml_ (XML) file lists all AIA URLs and extraction errors found.

#### 4. Certificates with AIA Information (_allcertsfoundaturi.csv_)

The _allcertsfoundaturi.csv_ (Microsoft Excel) file lists all AIA URLs and CA certificates and extraction errors found. 

* The key columns include:&nbsp;&nbsp;Error (if any), Certificate DN, Issuer (DN), Serial Number, Not Before, Sig Alg (Signing Algorithm), Subject Key, and Authority Key.

#### 5. All Certificates File (_allcerts.csv_)

The _allcerts.csv_ (Microsoft Excel) file lists all CA certificates found. This file is helpful when you want to analyze certificates. 

* The key columns include:&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject DN, Issuer DN, (Certificate) Group, Serial (Number), Sig Alg (Signing Algorithm) (typically SHA1 or SHA-256), Subject Key, and Authority Key.
* If found in a certificate, the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) URL will be listed in the OCSP HTTP column. The Certificate Revocation List Distribution Point (CRLDP) URLs will be listed in three columns: CDRLDP HTTP; the CDRLDP LDAP; and the CRLDP, AIA and SIA ERRORS.
* The AIA and SIA URLs for Object Identifiers (OIDs) (i.e., OIDs are id-ad-caIssuers, id-ad-caRepository, and id-ad-timeStamping) will be listed in these columns:&nbsp;&nbsp;AIA id-ad-caIssuers HTTP; AIA id-ad-caIssuers LDAP; AIA id-ad-caRepository LDAP; SIA id-ad-caIssuers HTTP; SIA id-ad-caRepository HTTP; SIA id-ad-caRepository LDAP; SIA id-ad-caRepository LDAP; SIA id-ad-timeStamping HTTP; SIA id-ad-timeStamping LDAP; and CRLDP, AIA and SIA ERRORS. 

### Public Certificates for Download

The FPKI Crawler provides all CA public certificates that it finds for analysis and download.

{% include alert-warning.html heading = "Do Not Import Certificates into a Trust Store before Analysis!" content="These certificates are available for analysis only. Please determine all applicable trust relationships before importing any certificate." %}

#### 1. All CA Certificates in a Single File (_CACertificatesValidatingToCommonPolicy.p7b_)

The _CACertificatesValidatingToCommonPolicy.p7b_ file contains all CA certificates found. You can easily sort these by expiration date, issuer, or subject. 

#### 2. All CA Certificates Broken Down into Eight Files (_CACertificatesValidatingToCommonPolicy_1.p7b_ through _8.p7b_)

The files, _CACertificatesValidatingToCommonPolicy_1.p7b_ through _CACertificatesValidatingToCommonPolicy_8.p7b_, contain all CA certificates found, broken down into eight files to simplify analysis and download.

#### 3. Certificate Files Grouped by Type and Organization (Additional _.p7b_ Certificates)

For these .p7b files, the CA certificates are grouped by _Type_ and _Organization_ into two files: 

* All CA certificates found
* All CA certificates found, plus any other certificate needed to validate to COMMON.

> For example:&nbsp;&nbsp;the _US_Government_VA.p7b_ (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs) contains two CA certificates issued by the Verizon Federal Shared Service Provider CA. To validate their paths to COMMON requires a Betrusted cross-certificate, so the _US_Government_VA_FullPath.p7b_ contains the two CA certificates, plus the Betrusted cross-certificate.
