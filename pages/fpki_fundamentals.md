## Public Key Infrastructure

Public Key Infrastructure topics are to help program managers and engineers understand what a Public Key Infrastructure is, and what the Federal Public Key Infrastructure contains. 

We are migrating topics and content developed by the US Government and engineers, from sources that currently exists in word, pdf and other formats.  

Examples of topics we're working on:

* What is Public Key Infrastructure?
* Why Use PKI?
* What are the components of the Federal PKI?
* What is a digital signature?
* What is encryption?
* What are the Different Types of Certificates and their Purpose?

We invite you to contribute or send in links to US Government sites or pages with information we can share!
