**PIV-I Certification Playbook**
======================

Personal Identity Verification Interoperability (PIV-I) guidance has been issued to facilitate the issuance of identity credentials by organizations that are interoperable with Federal PIV-conformant systems and can be trusted by Federal organizations. In order to achieve this level of trust, PIV-I credentials must include digital credentials from a certification authority cross-certified with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) at the Medium Hardware Level of Assurance or above whose cross-certificate relationship includes PIV-I policy object identifiers (OIDs).

The Federal government has established a  [FPKI Approved Providers List](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000XRrC) for entities that have demonstrated the ability to provide digital credentials that meet the expectations of the PIV-I guidance by demonstrating comparability with the appropriate FBCA policies.

This playbook provides information and activities related to the cross-certification process for prospective PIV-I Providers, resulting in inclusion on the  [FPKI Approved Providers List](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000XRrC) It also describes requirements that must be met to maintain cross-certification.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level PIV-I Certification process.

# ***Play 1 Understand Roles and Responsibilities***

The Federal Public Key Infrastructure Policy Authority (FPKIPA) is the inter-agency body set up under the CIO Council to enforce digital certificate standards for trusted identity authentication across the federal agencies and between federal agencies and outside bodies, such as universities, state and local governments and commercial entities.

The FPKI Certificate Policy Working Group (CPWG) reviews a prospective PIV-I Provider’s documentation for cross-certification of the PIV-I Provider with the PIV-I requirements specified in the  [X.509 Certificate Policy (CP) for the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA)](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000SfwS), and makes recommendations for cross-certification to the FPKIPA. The CPWG is comprised of representatives from organizations that are members of the FPKIPA.


The FIPS 201 Evaluation Program performs PIV-I card interoperability testing. A favorable recommendation from the CPWG (after successful card interoperability testing) will be presented to the FPKIPA members for a vote to approve the applicant as a PIV-I Provider at their earliest convenience.

# ***Play 2 Know The PIV-I Components***
The PIV-I Provider must implement six distinct components: 

- Certification Authority (CA); 
- Registration Authority (RA); 
- Card Management System (CMS); 
- Repository; 
- Archive; and 
- Online Certificate Status Protocol Server (OCSP) for PIV-I Providers   that support PIV-I authentication and/or PIV-I card authentication. 

While there are many ways to architect, deploy and manage these components, the responsibilities of the components remain the same:

- The CA issues X.509 certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRL) that conform to FBCA PIV-I; 
- The RA performs identity proofing for prospective certificate subjects in a manner that conforms to FBCA PIV-I; 
- RA/CMS operator collects biometrics and puts them on the PIV-I cards;
- The CMS issues PIV-I cards; 
- The Repository publishes CA certificates and CRLs; and 
- The Archive provides long-term secure storage for certificates and CRLs issued by the CA, CA and RA electronic and physical audit logs, audit results, and policy documents. 
- The OCSP servers provide revocation status of X.509 certificates 

The FPKIPA does not limit outsourcing of specific PKI services by the PIV-I Provider. For example, RA responsibilities may be outsourced to an external organization. However, the responsibility for the continuing conformance of the RA remains between the organization and the PIV-I Provider.

### **Checklist**

 - [ ] Implement OCSP servers
 - [ ] Determine your PIV-I architecture 
 - [ ] Fully understand all PIV-I requirements

### **Key Questions**

1. Do you fully understand what each PIV-I component does and how it fits into the overall PIV-I solution you are providing?
2. Will you be outsourcing any of your PIV-I components?
3. If outsourcing, do you understand your ongoing responsibilities in that context?

# ***Play 3 Prepare for PIV-I Cross-certification***

PIV-I cross certification with the FBCA encompasses six primary activities:

- Application for Cross Certification 
- Policy Mapping 
- Technical Testing 
- Audit Review 
- Memorandum of Agreement 
- Cross Certification 

All entities must complete the full cross certification process for FBCA cross certification at PIV-I, which is discussed in detail in the following section.

### **Checklist**

- [ ] Fully Understand what each PIV-I certification step entails 
- [ ] Resources needed for PIV-I Cross-certification process ready and available
- [ ] Approval of senior management to offer PIV-I services

### **Key Questions**

1. Does your PIV-I solution support smart cards that conform to the latest [NIST Special Publication 800-73](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html) and listed on the  [FIPS 201  Evaluation Program Approved Products List (APL)](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/IDMFicamProductSearchPage).

# ***Play 4 Submit Application for PIV-I Cross-certification*** 

The first step in achieving PIV-I cross certification with the FBCA is to submit a [PIV-I Application](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/servlet/fileField?entityId=ka0t0000000TNPRAA4&field=File__Body__s) to the FPKIPA. 

The [PIV-I Application](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/servlet/fileField?entityId=ka0t0000000TNPRAA4&field=File__Body__s) must indicate that PIV-I cross certification is sought.

Upon receipt, the FPKIPA will review the application and determine whether cross-certification is in the best interest of the U.S. Federal Government. The Applicant will be notified of the FPKIPA’s decision. Those whose applications have been approved will move into the mapping and technical testing phase.

Organizations whose applications are rejected by the FPKIPA may request a written decision and an interview with the FPKIPA for reconsideration.

### **Checklist**

- [ ] Obtain the latest application template
- [ ] Application fully and correctly completed
- [ ] Application indicates PIV-I cross certification is sought  
- [ ] Application submitted to correct FPKIPA email address
- [ ] Receipt of application by FPKIPA confirmed


### **Key Questions**

1. Does your application include a complete and compelling discussion of why your PIV-I application is in the best interest of the U.S. Federal Government?

# ***Play 5 Perform a Policy Mapping***

The FBCA Certificate Policy includes specific requirements pertaining to PIV-I. Entities should familiarize themselves with the following documents prior to beginning the mapping process:

- [X.509 CP for the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA)](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000SfwS) 
- [PIV Interoperability for Non-Federal Issuers](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000SfwZ) 
- [Cross-certification Framework for Cross-certification with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA)](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000SfwQ) 
- [X.509 Certificate and CRL Extensions Profile for PIV-I Cards](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/document_detail?Id=kA0t00000008ObiCAE) 

Each PIV-I Provider must submit the following in order to initiate the mapping process:

- X.509 CP governing the PKI that will provide the PIV-I service formatted according to RFC 3647 
- X.509 Certification Practices Statement (CPS) that implements the associated Certificate Policy 
- Completed mapping matrices available at [IDManagement.gov](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000Sfx1):  
- Any additional documentation referenced in either the CP or the CPS that is required to determine mapping comparability. 

The CPWG will review the PIV-I mapping matrices to determine their overall satisfaction of alignment with the FBCA CP. Questions or concerns that cannot be answered by consulting the supporting documentation provided with the matrix will be referred back to the applicant for resolution. If necessary, the CPWG will invite the applicant to a meeting to resolve open issues. In some cases, the applicant may be asked to provide copies of additional documents cited in the CP, where these are considered critical to resolving particular issues or concerns. This is an iterative process and may be repeated several times before successful completion. Any areas of concern will be discussed with the PIV-I Provider and resolved prior to providing a mapping recommendation to the FPKIPA.

The PIV-I Provider shall operate their PKIs in a manner that ensures continuing alignment with the FBCA CP. Each PIV-I Provider shall develop and operate their systems according to a CPS governing operation of its PKI. The PIV-I Provider’s CPS must be in compliance with their Certificate Policy.

### **Checklist**

- [ ] Completely familiar with pertinent documents before mapping begins
- [ ] Meet with CPWG mapping support team before mapping begins to fully understand how best to complete mapping tables
- [ ] All tabs, questions, tables in the mapping form completely addressed 
- [ ] Latest and correctly-formatted CP included in the application package
- [ ] Latest CPS that implements the associated CP included in the application package
- [ ] All documentation referenced in either the CP or the CPS that is required to determine mapping comparability included in the application package
- [ ] Point of Contact specified in case iterations with the CPWG are needed to fix mappings  
- [ ] Mapping material submitted to [fpki-compliance@gsa.gov](fpki-compliance@gsa.gov)
- [ ] Receipt of mapping material by the CPWG confirmed

### **Key Questions**
1. Does my CP or CPS reference any documents that I need to include in the mapping package?

# ***Play 6 Complete Technical Testing***

The PIV-I applicant must successfully complete technical testing in accordance with the  [PIV-I Test Plan](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000SfwZ). The purpose of technical testing is to validate the ability of a PIV-I candidate to issue PIV-I cards that meet the test requirements. Testing can be done any time after the application has been accepted.  To expedite the certification process, testing can be done in parallel with the mapping step.  However, testing must always be done with a "production card" issued by a production Issuing CA.

PIV-I Providers who operate under the PIV-I program must support smart cards conforming to  the latest [NIST Special Publication 800-73](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html) and listed on the  [FIPS 201  Evaluation Program Approved Products List (APL)](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/IDMFicamProductSearchPage).

If the PIV-I applicant does not successfully complete the requirements of the  [PIV-I Test Plan](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000SfwZ), the applicant will be provided with a list of criteria that were not met.  PIV-I testing must be successfully completed before a PIV-I Issuer Applicant   is taken to the FPKIPA for approval

Successful PIV-I implementation is dependent on the CMS. As a result, the CMS must be identified during the testing process. Organizations that plan to use multiple CMS products shall submit at least one card associated with each CMS for testing. Once complete, the approved PIV-I Provider shall list their approved CMS(s).  Subsequent testing is required as follows:

- New testing shall be performed whenever a new CMS is  instantiated in association with a specific PIV-I Provider.
- Annual PIV-I card testing shall be performed for each approved PIV-I Card Issuer

Upon successful completion of the  [PIV-I Test Plan](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000SfwZ), the results  are reported to the FPKIPA.

### **Checklist**

- [ ] Technical resources are identified and available if requested to support technical testing or to fix identified issues
- [ ] All CMS(s) identified and communicated to the ICAM Lab
- [ ] At least one test card per identified CMS submitted to the ICAM Lab

### **Key Questions**

   1. Does your PIV-I solution use more than one CMS?
   2. Know when testing is scheduled and who the ICAM Lab contacts are?

# ***Play 7 Complete an Audit Review***

To provide assurance of that their CP and CPS reflect their operations, PIV-I Providers must submit a compliance audit from a qualified, independent, third party auditor, in accordance with Section 8 of the FBCA CP, that establishes:

- The PIV-I Provider CPS is in compliance with its Certificate Policy; 
- The PIV-I PKI is operated in compliance with the CPS.  The audit needs to cover all functionalities whether independently operated or not.  This includes anything a customer organization may do such as RA/CMS functions.

For an initial audit review, operational compliance may be determined by a Day Zero Audit, which covers all aspects of the PKI operations except issuance and management of end user certificates.

The PIV-I Provider and their third party auditor should consult [FPKI Compliance Audit Requirements](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/document_detail?Id=kA0t00000008OcsCAE) for guidance on preparing the audit letter to the FPKIPA.

### **Checklist**

- [ ] Obtain qualified, independent, third party auditor to perform PIV-I audit
- [ ] Appropriate audit performed (full audit vs day zero audit)
- [ ] Audit compliance performed in accordance with FBCA CP Section 
- [ ] Latest FPKIPA Letter of Compliance requirements document reviewed and fully understood
- [ ] Audit Compliance Letter completed, reviewed, signed
- [ ] Audit Compliance Letter submitted to  [fpki-compliance@gsa.gov](fpki-compliance@gsa.gov)
- [ ] Receipt of Audit Compliance Letter by the FPKIPA confirmed

### **Key Questions**

1. Is this an initial audit review, in which case a Day Zero Compliance Audit can be performed instead of full audit?

# ***Play 8 Execute a Memorandum of Agreement*** 

Once all of the above criteria have been successfully completed, the CPWG will submit a recommendation to the FPKIPA to cross certify with the applicant at the identified levels of assurance, including PIV-I. Upon a favorable vote, the applicant and the Chairs of the FPKIPA shall complete a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) citing each organization’s rights and responsibilities associated with the cross certification.

### **Checklist**

- [ ] Obtain a copy of the final proposed MOA
- [ ] Proposed MOA reviewed by appropriate personnel
- [ ] Any changes negotiated and agreed to are reflected in the latest proposed MOA
- [ ] Fully understand the rights and responsibilities of all parties to the proposed MOA
- [ ] Receive copy of fully-executed MOA

### **Key Questions**

1. Are any changes to the proposed MOA needed that should be communicated to the FPKIPA?   
2. Who is the appropriate person to sign the MOA on behalf of the PIV-I Provider?

# ***Play 9 Coordinate Cross-certificate Issuance*** 

Once the MOA is complete, the Federal PKI Management Authority (FPKIMA) and the Applicant coordinate the steps necessary to issue cross-certificates.

The entity will then be added to the [FPKI Approved Providers List](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000XRrC).

### **Checklist**

- [ ] Establish contact with the FPKIMA to initiate exchange of cross-certificates
- [ ] Fully understand process to exchange cross-certificates
- [ ] Confirm listing on the [FPKI Approved Providers List](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000XRrC)

### **Key Questions**

1. Have you reviewed all forms associated with exchanging cross-certificates to ensure you have obtained all the latest information you need to provide the FPKIMA.
2. Is the information you will be providing correct and up-to-date?

# ***Play 10 Perform Annual Compliance Audit*** 
The [Compliance Audit Requirements](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/document_detail?Id=kA0t00000008OcsCAE) document mandates yearly compliance audits performed by a competent, independent third party. The PIV-I Provider has ongoing audit and analysis responsibilities to ensure that the PKI continues to operate at the appropriate level of trustworthiness.

The PIV-I Provider shall submit a compliance audit letter each year covering PIV-I operated components for as long as they continue. If it is determined that a PIV-I Provider is out of compliance, the PIV-I Provider shall submit a remediation plan to the CPWG for consideration. Failure to submit an annual compliance audit letter, or findings that indicate the PIV-I Provider is out of alignment with the FBCA CP will result in removal from the  [FPKI Approved Providers List](https://www.idmanagement.gov/IDM/s/article_content_old?tag=a0Gt0000000XRrC) and/or revocation of the cross certificates.

### **Checklist**

- [ ] Understand ongoing compliance audit requirements and due dates 
- [ ] Performed annual compliance audit and submit Annual Compliance Audit Letter to the FPKIPA
- [ ] If notified of non-compliance, fully understand non-compliance items, and determine degree of agreement.
- [ ] If disagreement with non-compliance items, begin discussions with FPKIPA
- [ ] If notified of non-compliance, gather appropriate staff and begin remediation process
- [ ] If requested, understand scope/content of Remediation Plan and submit Remediation Plan to the FPKIPA

### **Key Questions**

1. If notified of non-compliance, do you fully understand and agree with the list of non-compliance items?
