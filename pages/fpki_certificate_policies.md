### What is a Certificate Policy?

The certificate policy specifies the the security requirement, issuance procedure and protection of the private key associated with a certificate.  Certificate policies are identified in a certificate by including one or more Object Identifiers (OIDs).  

>A Certificate Policy (CP) is defined in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification Practices Framework as "a named set of rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate to a particular community and/or class of application with common security requirements".

When a Certification Authority (CA) issues a certificate, it is providing a statement to a certificate user that a public key is bound to an _entity_.

> _Entity_ can be a person, device, website, or organization

The Certificate Policy provides the information that can be used by a certificate user to decide whether or not to trust a certificate.

### Why do we use Certificate Policies?
Certificate policies are used to establish trust relationships between Certificate Authorities.  This is called _cross-certification_. When CAs issue cross certificates, one CA assesses and recognizes one or more certificate polices of the other CA.

### What are the Certificate Policy Object Identifiers?
The Federal PKI has twenty-five (25) certificate policies for people and non-person entity (NPE) certificates.   

* Twelve (12) of the certificate policies are used only within the Federal Bridge Certificate Authority to map organizational policies across the issuing CAs and Bridges.
* Thirteen (13) certificate policies are used for the final end entity certificates.

All certificate policies denote a US Government issued and authorized certificate.  
The Commercial Best Practices (CBP) identifier on certificate policies indicate the trusted roles or individuals assigned a role in certificate issuance do not have to be U.S. citizens.  
A hardware (HW) identifier indicate the private key is generated and protected on a hardware based token.  
The risk level referenced refers to the level of risk associated with transactions accepting certificates
issued under the specified certificate policy.
