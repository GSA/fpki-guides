In **October 2020**, the Federal Government created new Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) Root Certification Authority (CA).  The new root is named the **Federal Common Policy CA G2**. 

Between December 2020 and May 2021, the CAs signed by the old root will be migrated to be signed by this new root: Federal Common Policy CA G2.  Once the migration is complete, the old root will be decommissioned. 

## What will be impacted?

**This change will affect all federal agencies** and will have an impact on the following services:

- Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential authentication to the government networks
- Agency web applications implementing client authentication (e.g., PIV authentication)
- User digital signatures that leverage PIV or similar credentials 
- Other applications leveraging the Federal Common Policy CA as a root


## When will this change take place?
Tentative time-line:
- **October 14, 2020**: The Federal PKI Management Authority (FPKIMA) created the new Federal Common Policy CA G2 root 
- **October 15, 2020**: The FPKIMA team issued a cross certificate from the Federal Common Policy CA G2 to the Federal Bridge CA G4
- **November 18, 2020**: The FPKIMA team will issue CA certificates to migrate agency and shared service providers CAs to the new root: Federal Common Policy CA G2 
- **December 2020 to May 2021**: All agencies will need to transition from using the old Federal Common Policy CA as the root to the new Federal Common Policy CA G2 *(approximately six months)*
- **May 2021**: The FPKIMA team will decommission the old Federal Common Policy CA 

## What should I do?
To prevent issues, agencies **must** distribute the Federal Common Policy CA G2 root certificate as a trusted Root Certification Authority to workstations and servers **_as soon as it is available_**.

{% include alert-info.html content="The Federal Common Policy CA G2 CA certificate is expected for distribution on <strong>October 14, 2020</strong>.  This announcement will be updated once the certificate is available." %}
